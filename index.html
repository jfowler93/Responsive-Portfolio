                    My name is Joshua Fowler. I am 26 years old and I live in Downtown Orlando, Florida. I graduated UCF
                    in
                    2015
                    with a
                    bachelor's degree in human communications. With that degree I worked in radio for 5 years and
                    continue
                    to
                    dabble
                    while I bartend and go to school.
                    I am currently enrolled in UCF coding bootcamp in order to learn a new skill set and enter a new
                    career
                    field.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have been married to my wife for just 4 months now. We have two beautiful cats together. We also
                    still
                    have a
                    roommate, which is similar to having a child.
                    Together we enjoy travelling, trying new foods and cocktails, and going to shows.

                    Working in radio has afforded me some cool opportunities. For example, I once shared a stage with
                    Coolio
                    and
                    Joey
                    Fatone. However, nothing compares to the sense of accomplishment felt when your nephews are
                    marginally
                    impressed
                    by
                    your collection of Fortnite skins.
